# Project 1: Traffic Animation

* Author: Matt Fuller
* Class: CS121 Section 6
* Semester: Spring 2017

## Overview

Animates a vehicle driving down a road relative to an anchor position using methods  
from the the Graphics class and colors from the Color class. Also includes an avatar 
observing the car.

## Testing

First, copy the p1 file from Eclipse and upload it into Onyx by opening Onyx 
and locating the directory you want to upload the p1 file into. 

Next, open file explorer and locate the p1 file. 

The only files you need to copy are the ".java" and the "README" files. 
Click and drag the files directly into a directory on Onyx.

Compile the program by executing the following command in the main project 
directory:
```
$ javac TrafficAnimation.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java TrafficAnimation
```

## Discussion

The first thing I did after reading the program specifications was 
look at previous examples. Next, I sketched out and a vehicle, avatar, and other 
elements so I could get an idea of where I needed to position everything.
I began coding the program by prioritizing which elements needed
to be coded first. 
  
Some of the objects were difficult to scale. For example, when I was 
drawing my avatar it was difficult to position the head above the body
when the screen was resized. At some points, it was just trial and error.

I found it very helpful having example codes of programs that showed 
how to use different different methods, like how to set the font and 
size of your text. 

I felt like I managed the variables well. This makes it easier to follow
along with the comments.
 
The errors I encountered were mostly scaling errors. There were many 
equations used to position and update positions for each element used, so
the errors were shapes in the wrong position. I fixed some by just reevaluating 
the scaling equations, but most were by trail and error.  
  
This project gave me more practice using the Graphics class and managing 
variables. Everything that I learned in this project will apply to future projects. 
Most of the programs will have similar structures, so developing programs in the 
future should be easier.
